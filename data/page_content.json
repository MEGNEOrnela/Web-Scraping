Some food makers use sugar substitutes in place of sugar to make foods and drinks taste sweet. These sweeteners don\u2019t have nutrients to help kids grow. Products like diet soda, sports drinks, or yogurts that are made with them may say \u201csugar-free\u201d or \u201czero calorie\u201d on the label.\nTwo common sugar substitutes are aspartame and sucralose. They taste much sweeter than real sugar, so foods and drinks made with them have just a tiny amount. Experts now know that tiny amounts of sugar substitutes are safe for some kids, but only if they eat other foods that give them all the nutrients they need.\nHow Are Sugar Substitutes Different From Sugar?\nOur bodies handle sugar and sugar substitutes in different ways. When we eat sugar, our bodies turn it into energy. But they can\u2019t do this with sugar substitutes. Instead, these pass right through the body.\nAre Sugar Substitutes Safe for My Child?\nSugar substitutes are safe for some kids. It depends on a child\u2019s age and if they have any health problems. Here\u2019s a guide:\nBabies and children younger then 2 years old should never have sugar substitutes. Young children need many nutrients for their brains and bodies to grow well, and sugar substitutes have none.\nMost kids older than 2 can have sugar substitutes as long as they get enough nutrients from their diet to grow normally. This is called balanced eating. Kids over 2 years can have up to 6\u20138 ounces of foods or drinks made with sugar substitutes a day.\nKids older than 2 who have diabetes can have sugar substitutes if their doctor says it\u2019s OK. Doctors usually prefer that kids with diabetes have drinks made with sugar substitutes because they don\u2019t make blood sugars spike like drinks made with sugar.\nKids older than 2 who have PKU shouldn\u2019t have sugar substitutes because their bodies can\u2019t digest them safely.\nWhat\u2019s the Best Drink for My Child?\nKids should drink what\u2019s right for their age:\nBabies up to 1 year old should drink breast milk or formula. These have all the nutrients babies need to grow.\nToddlers 1\u20132 years old should drink water and whole milk. Whole milk has the right amount of fat to help toddlers\u2019 young brains grow.\nKids over 2 years old should drink water, and low-fat or nonfat milk. These are always the best choices.\nIf you have questions about sugar substitutes, check with your child\u2019s doctor.\nMedically reviewed by: Kathryn Russel, MS, RDN\nDate reviewed: August 2023\nMORE ON THIS TOPIC FOR:\nParents\nKids\nTeens\nWhat\u2019s Best for Your Baby to Drink?\nNutrition & Fitness Center\nSports Drinks and Energy Drinks\nShare:\nShare to Facebook\nShare to Twitter\nShare to Pinterest\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nPartners\nEditorial Policy\nPermissions Guidelines\nPrivacy Policy & Terms of Use\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nNote: All information on Nemours\u00ae KidsHealth\u00ae is for educational purposes only.

Because the fat portion of whole milk does not contain calcium, you can lose the fat without losing any calcium.\nReduced-fat (2%), low-fat (1%), and nonfat milk have vitamin A and vitamin D added, since these vitamins are lost when the fat is removed. Natural levels of vitamin D are low, so most milk producers add vitamin D to whole milk.

Gavin, MD\nListen\nPrint\nI know that only a certain amount of your calories should come from fat, but how do you calculate that percentage?\n\u2013 Brian\nTo calculate this, divide a food or drink's calories from fat by total calories (this information is on the product's food label) and then multiply by 100. For example, if a 300-calorie food has 60 calories from fat, divide 60 by 300 and then multiply by 100. That food has 20% of its calories from fat (60\u00f7300=0.2 / 0.2x100=20).\nMost kids and teens should get 25% to 35% of total calories each day from fat.\nToddlers ages 1 to 3 should get 30% to 40% of total calories from fat.\nHealthy adults should get 20% to 35% of calories from mostly monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats (from nuts and seeds and plant oils such as olive oil or canola oil, etc.).\nSaturated fat and trans fat (for instance, from fatty meats or full-fat dairy products) can raise cholesterol and increase the risk of heart disease. Saturated fats should make up less than 10% of a person's daily total calories. Trans fats should be kept as low as possible.\nMedically reviewed by: Mary L.

Gavin, MD\nListen\nPrint\nMy daughter would be happy eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. How can I get her to eat different foods?\n\u2013 Carlene\nIt can be frustrating when kids want to eat the same thing every day \u2014 but it's not uncommon. Some kids get stuck on a favorite food while others complain they don't like certain foods, like vegetables.\nOffer your daughter a variety of healthy foods. Encourage her to try the foods you serve, but don't force her to eat them. Set a good example by eating a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and healthy protein.\nAsk your daughter what fruits, vegetables, and other healthy foods she is willing to try. Look for recipes with ingredients your kids like, and invite them to join you in the grocery shopping, cooking, and serving of foods.\nSince your daughter likes peanut butter, let her put it on other foods, like apples or celery. Sometimes preparing foods differently, presenting foods in interesting ways, or using cookie cutters to cut food into fun shapes can make foods more appealing to picky eaters.\nIt's important not to let a child's pickiness become a source of mealtime tension. Don't cook special meals just for a picky eater, but do include something your daughter likes in every meal. Ask her to take at least two bites of what you made, but it's OK if she chooses not to eat more than that. And it might be tempting, but don't use food as a reward. Telling kids they can have a cookie if they eat their broccoli only reinforces the appeal of the cookie over the veggies.\nIf you have concerns about your child's nutrition, ask your doctor or a nutritionist for more advice on how to handle a picky eater.\nMedically reviewed by: Mary L.

Pregnant women need about 300 extra calories a day, especially later in pregnancy, when babies grow quickly.\nIt's also important to avoid certain foods that can be harmful to a developing baby.

What Can I Do?\nMy Toddler Hates Vegetables. What Can I Do?\nMedically reviewed by: Mary L. Gavin, MD\nListen\nPrint\nMy 2-year-old used to be a pretty good eater. But now she's going through a phase where she won't even try the vegetables I serve. How can I get more veggies into her mouth and off the floor?\n\u2013 Mila\nAs most parents know, there are two things you can't force a child to do: eat and sleep. This is especially true of toddlers, who often assert their independence through eating \u2014 or not eating \u2014 the foods you put on their plates.\nMany toddlers turn their noses up at vegetables. But don't give up \u2014 with time and patience, even the pickiest eaters can find several veggies they like (and a few they even love!).\nHere are some tips that might help:\nDon't give in to a food jag. Most young children go through phases where they want to eat the same thing day after day. But that doesn't mean you have to go along with it. Serving a variety of foods, including vegetables, will encourage your daughter to be more flexible when she's hungry.\nIf at first you don't succeed, try and try again. Studies have shown it may take 10 or more tries before a child accepts a new food. Try serving a small portion so it's less overwhelming or consider pairing veggies with something you know she likes.\nAvoid nagging, forcing, bargaining, or bribing. All of these tactics create power struggles and are doomed to fail in the long run. Just continue offering veggie choices and encourage her to give them a try. Keep mealtime moods upbeat.\nSet a good example. Have family meals together and let your child see you eating a variety of nutritious foods yourself. Also, toddlers are more likely to eat what their peers eat, so look for opportunities where she can eat healthfully with friends.\nInvolve her in choosing the vegetables you serve. For example, she could decide whether you'll have green beans or broccoli tonight, or whether you'll bake zucchini or carrot muffins. Simple choices will help her feel a sense of control.\nMake it fun. Try making a veggie face (like cucumber eyes, tomato nose, green bean mouth, and shredded carrot hair). Try serving veggies with yogurt dip or sprinkled with cheese.\nOne thing to keep in mind when serving fresh fruit and veggies: Raw vegetables and hard fruits can be a choking hazard for young children. Be sure to cook them well, and thinly slice or cut them into small enough pieces so that they're not a choking risk.\nMedically reviewed by: Mary L.

My baby is too young to start solids. What should I do if I can\u2019t find formula?\n\u2013 Stella\nThere is indeed a national shortage of baby formula in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic created supply chain and staffing issues, and a recent recall of baby formula due to contaminated products from a key factory added to the problem.\nHere are some tips on how to deal with the baby formula shortage:\nTalk to your baby\u2019s doctor. They might have sample cans of formula available and also can ask the manufacturer for specific types of formula. You can also call a local hospital, office of WIC (the federal Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children), or an established breast milk bank. Women\u2019s shelters, food banks, and faith-based organizations also might be able to help. Avoid using breast milk from friends, community members, or online sources. These donations may not have been properly stored or pasteurized and can contain germs or other harmful substances.\nShop around. Try other stores that you may not have gone to in the past, especially smaller independent grocery stores, pharmacies, or baby supply stores. They might not run out of formula as quickly as bigger stores.\nOrder online if you can. Make sure that the websites are well-recognized companies and not auction sites or online marketplaces that can\u2019t guarantee safe products.\nSwitch to any available formula. This should be OK for most babies unless they are on a specific type of formula for medical reasons. Store-brand formulas are less expensive. Check with your baby\u2019s doctor if you are not sure about making a switch.\nConnect with other parents (in person or on social media groups). They might have extra formula or ideas about where to get some.\nDo not give your baby:\nhomemade formula. This can be dangerous and has even led to infant deaths.\nwatered-down formula to make it last longer. This is dangerous, as it reduces the amount of nutrients in each bottle. Always follow instructions on the package or recommendations from your baby\u2019s doctor.\ngoat milk or plant-based milks (like almond, rice, coconut, or oat milks) if your baby is younger than 1 year old. These milks lack the nutrients your baby needs for growth and development.\nNOTE: Cow\u2019s milk usually is only recommended for babies after their first birthday. In an emergency, though, babies 6 months of age and older who do not get a specific type of formula for medical reasons can drink cow's milk, but for no longer than a week and not more than 24 ounces per day. Cow\u2019s milk does not contain enough iron for a growing baby. So, if you give your baby cow\u2019s milk, also offer iron-containing solid foods or iron supplements. Soy milk also may be OK for a few days for babies who are close to 1 year old, as long as it is fortified with protein and calcium.\nformula you bought overseas. Foreign products are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and may not be safe. For this reason, goat milk formula is not an option for babies younger than 1 year old because infant-appropriate goat milk formulas are all made overseas.\ntoddler formula. If your baby is nearing their first birthday, though, toddler formula can be OK for a few days.\nIf you run out of formula and can\u2019t find any, in a pinch you can give oral rehydration solution (such as Pedialyte, Enfalyte, or a store brand) for a couple of days. Babies older than 4 to 6 months can also get pur\u00e9ed (finely ground) foods. And remember that babies older than 1 year do not need to drink formula at all \u2014 most of their foods can be eaten as solids and they can drink milk or water.\nMore information is available online at:\nU.S. Department of Health & Human Services\nMedically reviewed by: Elana Pearl Ben-Joseph, MD\nDate reviewed: May 2022\nMORE ON THIS TOPIC FOR:\nParents\nFeeding Your Newborn\nIs Homemade Baby Formula Safe?\nFeeding Your 1- to 3-Month-Old\nFormula Feeding FAQs: Preparation and Storage\nFormula Feeding FAQs: Starting Solids and Milk\nView more\nShare:\nShare to Facebook\nShare to Twitter\nShare to Pinterest\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nPartners\nEditorial Policy\nPermissions Guidelines\nPrivacy Policy & Terms of Use\nNotice of Nondiscrimination\nNote: All information on Nemours\u00ae KidsHealth\u00ae is for educational purposes only.

That's because it adds extra calories without the balanced nutrition in formula and breast milk. Drinking too much juice also may lead to excess weight and tooth decay, or cause diarrhea in infants and toddlers. \nInstead of juice, serve pur\u00e9ed whole fruits and vegetables. They have important nutrients not found in juice. If your baby seems thirsty, offer a little bit of water between feedings.\nIf a toddler does drink juice, follow these tips:\nServe only 100% fruit juice, not juice drinks or powdered drink mixes (which are sweetened).\nLimit the juice to no more than 2\u20134 fl. oz.
